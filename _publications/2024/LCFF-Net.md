abstract: >-
  Proposed <strong>LCFF-Net</strong>, a computationally efficient algorithm that significantly improves tiny target detection performance in UAV imagery through improved cross-scale feature fusion. The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and inference speed, offering a robust solution for real-time aerial applications.
