  Hello. I am Daoze Tang, an incoming Master's student in Computer Science and Technology at <a href="https://www.cau.edu.cn/" target="_blank">China Agricultural University</a>, where I will be supervised by <a href="https://faculty.cau.edu.cn/lx_7543/list.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Xiang Li</a>. Currently, I am in the final stages of completing my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Internet of Things (IoT) Engineering at <a href="https://www.hrbcu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Harbin University of Commerce</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  My research interests lie broadly within the field of Computer Science, with a primary focus on <b>Computer Vision</b>, particularly Object Detection. I am dedicated to developing efficient algorithms and exploring robust visual recognition systems.
  </p>
  <p>
  Beyond individual research, I founded and currently lead a student research group dedicated to fostering motivated peers and organizing teams to participate in top-tier academic competitions.
  </p>
  <p>
  Outside the laboratory, I draw inspiration from the arts. I am an avid guitarist and enjoy exploring diverse literary genres.
